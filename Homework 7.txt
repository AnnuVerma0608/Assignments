 describe every pseudo class and pseudo elements and explain by an example.


 What are Pseudo-classes?


A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.

For example, it can be used to:

Style an element when a user mouses over it  // w3school
Style visited and unvisited links differently
Style an element when it gets focus

Anchor Pseudo-classes :

/* unvisited link */
a:link {
    color: #FF0000;
}

/* visited link */
a:visited {
    color: #00FF00;
}

/* mouse over link */
a:hover {
    color: #FF00FF;
}

/* selected link */
a:active {
    color: #0000FF;
}


// display :block // doubt  ask 

Pseudo-classes can be combined with CSS classes:example: 


1. The :first-child pseudo-class matches a specified element that is the first child of another element.

example : p:first-child {
    color: blue;
}


here the the selector matches any <p> element that is the first child of any element:


2. the selector matches any <p> element that is the first child of any element

A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element.


p i:first-child {
    color: blue;
}

<p>I am a <i>strong</i> person. I am a <i>strong</i> person.</p>
<p>I am a <i>strong</i> person. I am a <i>strong</i> person.</p>

here both the <i> will be the first child of both the <p> element.


3. The :lang pseudo-class allows you to define special rules for different languages.


<html>
<head>
<style>
q:lang(no) {
    quotes: "~" "~";
}
</style>
</head>

<body>
<p>Some text <q lang="no">A quote in a paragraph</q> Some text.</p>
</body>
</html>

output :

Some text A quote in a paragraph Some text.

In this example, :lang defines the quotation marks for q elements with lang="no":

What are Pseudo-Elements? 


pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element.


Style the first letter, or line, of an element
Insert content before, or after, the content of an element

The Syntax of pseudo elements :

selector::pseudo-element {
    property:value;
}

example :

The :: notation is used to differentiate the pseudo classes from pseudo elements // note 

p::first-line {
    color: #ff0000;
    font-variant: small-caps;
}

the above pseudo eleemnt is used to add special style to the first line of the text.

::first-line pseudo-element can only be applied to block-level elements. // note 


Similar to pseudo classes the pseudo elements can be combined with CSS classes.

p.intro::first-letter {
    color: #ff0000;
    font-size:200%;
}
