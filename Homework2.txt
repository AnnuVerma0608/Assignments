1.look into all the input attributes in html. when to use describe by example.

Input Type: text : Input Type: text : <input type="text"> defines a one-line input field for text input:

<input type="text" name="texttype"><br>

Input Type: password
<input type="password"> <br>


<input type="button" value="git button" width="100"> <br><br>
<input type="checkbox"> <br>
<input type="radio">

there are different types of input attributes : the different types of input attributes provide more meaning to the input attribue 
.

1. The value attribute specifies the initial value for an input field.  <input type="text" name="firstname" value="UIclassjuly7"> <br><br><br>
2. The type attribue specifies what type of input will it take.  <br>
3.The readonly attribute specifies that the input field is read only   <input type="text" name="firstname" value="UIclassjuly7" readonly> <br>
4. The disabled attribute specifies that the input field is disabled.    <input type="text" name="firstname" value="UIclassjuly7" disabled> <br>
5.The size attribute specifies the size (in characters) for the input field  <input type="text" name="firstname" value="UIclassjuly7" size="120"> <br>
<br><br>
6. The maxlength attribute specifies the maximum allowed length for the input field <input type="text" name="firstname" value="UIclassjuly7" maxlength="12"> <br>
7. The required attribute is a boolean attribute <input type="text" name="firstname" value="UIclassjuly7" required> <br> <input type="submit" name="button" value="submit">




2.what are semantic elements?

Semantic elements are elements with a meaning.

A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <img> - Clearly defines its content.

Semantic HTML or semantic markup is HTML that introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. For example, a <p> tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph. This is both semantic and presentational, because people know what a “paragraph” is and browsers know how to display them. In HTML4* tags like <b> and <i> are not semantic, because they define only how the text should look (bold or italic) and do not provide any meaning to the text.

Other examples of semantic HTML tags include the header tags <h1> through <h6>, <blockquote>, <code>, and <em>. And there are lots of other semantic HTML tags.

The benefit of writing semantic HTML stems from the goal of a web page—to communicate. And by adding semantic tags to your documents, you are providing additional information about your document, which aids in communication.


Semantic HTML tags provide information about the contents of those tags that goes beyond just how they look on a page.  (// source of information :http://
