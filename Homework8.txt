Advantages of using bootstrap.

Easy to use: Anybody with just basic knowledge of HTML and CSS can start using Bootstrap
Responsive features: Bootstrap's responsive CSS adjusts to phones, tablets, and desktops
Mobile-first approach: In Bootstrap 3, mobile-first styles are part of the core framework
Browser compatibility: Bootstrap is compatible with all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, and Opera)

Bootstrap's global default font-size is 14px, with a line-height of 1.428.

This is applied to the <body> and all paragraphs.

In addition, all <p> elements have a bottom margin that equals half their computed line-height (10px by default).

Containers
Bootstrap requires a containing element to wrap site contents and house our grid system. You may choose one of two containers to use in your projects. Note that, due to padding and more, neither container is nestable.

Use .container for a responsive fixed width container.

Copy
<div class="container">
  ...
</div>
Use .container-fluid for a full width container, spanning the entire width of your viewport.

Copy
<div class="container-fluid">
  ...
</div>


Bootstrap includes a responsive, mobile first fluid grid system that appropriately scales up to 12 columns as the device or viewport size increases. It includes predefined classes for easy layout options, as well as powerful mixins for generating more semantic layouts.

A jumbotron indicates a big box for calling extra attention to some special content or information.

A jumbotron is displayed as a grey box with rounded corners. It also enlarges the font sizes of the text inside it.

Tip: Inside a jumbotron you can put nearly any valid HTML, including other Bootstrap elements/classes.

The .well class adds a rounded border around an element with a gray background color and some padding:

Bootstrap allows you to group a series of buttons together (on a single line) in a button group:

Media queries
We use the following media queries in our Less files to create the key breakpoints in our grid system.

/* Extra small devices (phones, less than 768px) */
/* No media query since this is the default in Bootstrap */

/* Small devices (tablets, 768px and up) */
@media (min-width: @screen-sm-min) { ... }

/* Medium devices (desktops, 992px and up) */
@media (min-width: @screen-md-min) { ... }

/* Large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up) */
@media (min-width: @screen-lg-min) { ... }
