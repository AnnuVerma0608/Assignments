Hello World

<h1> heading tag  </h1>

this is one line 








this is the second .............................................................line




this is the second &nbsp;&nbsp;line
both of the above lines will come in the same line in the browser they will have space difference

suppose you want in different lines you need to use block elements.


there will only have one space in the second line

for multiple spaces nbsp non breakable space

reason: 

block elements : suppose you want content in new line . you can use bock level element .

<h1> -<h6>

are block level elements.

span :

<span1>hjxns</span1>

they are in same line

they are inline elements.

para is  also a block level  element
div is also a blaock level element

difference beteen para and div ?
 
 para has spaces in between lines but div doesnot have  that.

 in order to take the information from user we use input tag .

 there are few tags where the close tag is not manadatory one of tem is the input tag.

 example 

 <input> // input with no type attribue. </br> // input with no type attribue.
 <input type="text" name=""><br> // you can select and unselect  // in the text any information can be unentered.
 <input type="radio" name="">
 <input type="checkbox" name="">
 <input type="date" name="">
 <input type="number" name="">


 they are inline elements .


 Attributes .

 within the open tag in order to more information about the content.  we use attribute.

 you  can have multiple attributes in single tag.


 Homework 2:

 look into all the input attributes in html. when to use describe by example.

 what are sematic elements why they are helpful ? // w3  schools. HTML tag references and mozilla developer network, html5 doctor

 look into all possible tags.
