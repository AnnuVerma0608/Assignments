<h1> heading tag  </h1>

this is one line 








this is the second .............................................................line




this is the second &nbsp;&nbsp;line
both of the above lines will come in the same line in the browser they will have space difference

suppose you want in different lines you need to use block elements.


there will only have one space in the second line

for multiple spaces nbsp non breakable space

reason: 

block elements : suppose you want content in new line . you can use bock level element .

<h1> -<h6>

span :

<span1>hjxns</span1>

they are in same line

they are inline elements.
